**A Bit About Me**

I've always been interested in computers and programming from an early age, starting with my trusty VIC20 and game coding books... unfortunately due to many reasons I turned away from a programming course at college and joined the armed forces as a Gun fitter in the REME. This has always been a regret, not joining the army but not pursuing a programming career.

Now Iâ€™m trying again determined to reclaim that career direction I lost... nothing is going to stop me from pursuing and excelling in a career in web development. I have an unquestionable thirst for knowledge and coding is going to go a long way in quenching it.
