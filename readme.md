**A Bit About Me**

I've always been interested in computers and programming from an early age, starting with my trusty VIC20 and game coding books... unfortuntly due to many reasons i turned away from a programmig course at college and joined the armed forces as a Gunfitter in the REME.  This has always been a regret, not joining the army but, not pursuing a programming career.

Now i'm trying again determined to reclaim that career direction i lost... nothing is going to stop me from completing the full stack developer boot camp and persuing a career in the field.  I have an unquestionable thirst for knowledge and coding is going to go a long way in quenching it.  stay tuned!!!
